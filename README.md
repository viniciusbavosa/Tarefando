# Tarefando - Task Manager

![Tarefando Screenshot](https://tinypic.host/images/2024/06/06/Tarefando-lightd802b183cd482a1d.png)
<p align="center"><strong>This project is currently being refactored to use React and TypeScript.</strong></p>

## Context and Objective

I developed this project to help my dad, who often forgets his daily tasks. He's not a big fan of apps, so I built a simple task manager just for him using JavaScript.


## Features

- Tarefando allows you to create tasks and group them into collections if they are related to each other. For example, you can create a collection called **Bills** and store tasks related to monthly bill payments within it.

- By using IndexedDB and storing data locally, you don't have to worry about data loss if the internet goes down in the middle of an operation.

- You can add the application to your mobile or desktop homepage and use it as an executable/app. Tarefando is a **Progressive Web App**.

- You can choose whether you prefer light mode or if you find dark mode more pleasing.

- If the application's sounds disturb you, you can mute them in the sidebar.


## Technologies and Tools

- **Languages:** JavaScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Database:** IndexedDB

## Installation

```
Clone this repository
npm install
npm run build
Comment out the <base> tag in the index.html and collections.html files

```
